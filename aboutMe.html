                    as a Developer are two of my passions.<br>
                    While in college, I created software solutions for my projects that 
                    gave me the opportunity to thrive in the art and become quite comfortable with C# language manipulations.
                    Database design/maintenance (My SQL & T-SQL), software management, unit testing and 
                    debugging, and network architecture are all relevant abilities I'll bring to the team.</p>
                    <p class="gang">Furthermore, As a Full-Stack Developer âœ¨, I've mastered essential Front-end 
                        technologies like <i>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,</i> and knowledge of third-party 
                        libraries like <i>jQuery, LESS, Angular and ReactJS.</i><br>
                        Furthermore, I've essential knowledge on working with <i>Github repositories, 
                            Github Website deployment and Bootstrap.</i><br><br>
                        On the <i>Back-end side,</i> am quite conversant with <i>Python Data 
                            Structures & Algorithms, Python Socket & Security
